#### 2015-06-17

If you have questions about oTree, I will be available to give help via Skype call on **Tuesday June 23** at 4PM Zurich time (10AM New York time).
I will be online for 2 hours. You can ask any general questions, and we can use Skype/TeamViewer screen sharing to work through oTree installation or code writing.

You can add me on Skype by searching by my email (chris@otree.org).
