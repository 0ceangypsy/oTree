#### 2015-05-29: New version available

There is a new version of otree-core with the following improvements/bugfixes:

* Values in `session.vars` were sometimes not being saved
* Multi-field validation (`error_message`) was not properly displaying the error message to the user
* `get_players()` was sometimes returning players in the wrong order
* Better warning if database is not created
* Validate apps before publishing to MTurk
* Validation of min= and max= were not being done in Safari

To upgrade, modify the `otree-core` version number in `requirements_base.txt` (the
latest version is
[here](https://github.com/oTree-org/oTree/blob/master/requirements_base.txt)),
then run:

```
pip install -r requirements_base.txt
```

Thanks to the users who reported the above issues and made suggestions!
