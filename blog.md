#### 2015-11-15: Error notification service available

We have set up a service (Sentry) that can notify you by email when there is a 500 error on your server.
More info [here](http://otree.readthedocs.org/en/latest/server.html#sentry)

#### 2015-11-14: New version available

Here are some notable changes:

* Fixed a bug where `participant.vars` was sometimes not being saved

#### 2015-09-24: New version available

We have released a new version of otree-core. It is mostly a bugfix release, but has a few new features.
Here are some notable changes:

* More informative error message when there is a `TemplateSyntaxError`

#### 2015-08-07: New version available

We have released a new version of otree-core. It contains the following changes:

* Players are now grouped sequentially instead of randomly. For example, if you have `players_per_group=2`, then oTree will group players 1 and 2, then 3 and 4, etc.
* You should now put CSS and JavaScript in one of the following template blocks: `styles`, `app_styles`, `global_styles`; and `scripts`, `app_scripts`, `global_scripts`. See the [docs](http://otree.readthedocs.org/en/latest/templates.html#javascript-and-css). Putting jQuery code in a template's `content` block is now deprecated.
* Added the settings `REAL_WORLD_CURRENCY_DECIMAL_PLACES`, `POINTS_DECIMAL_PLACES`, and `POINTS_CUSTOM_NAME`. See the [docs](http://otree.readthedocs.org/en/latest/money.html#points-i-e-experimental-currency).
* Gave each page an attribute `timeout_happened` that tells whether a timeout took place. See the [docs](http://otree.readthedocs.org/en/latest/views.html#timeout-happened).
* We now recommend using the `otree` command rather than `python otree`, e.g. `otree resetdb`, `otree startapp`, `otree runserver`.
* Fixed several bugs related to stability and performance.
