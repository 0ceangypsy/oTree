oTree can be installed on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

## Windows
- Install [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.8/)
- Add `C:\Python27` to your system's `Path` environment variable
    * Open `System Properties` in the control panel
    * Switch to the `Advanced` tab
    * Click `Environment Variables`
    * Select `PATH` in the `System variables` section
    * Click `Edit`
    * Add python's path to the end of the list (the paths are separated by semicolons). For example:

        C:\Windows;C:\Windows\System32;C:\Python27

- Download and unzip the [oTree launcher](https://github.com/oTree-org/otree-launcher/archive/master.zip)
to an easy-to-access location, because you will go here every time you want to run the oTree launcher.
(In other words, you probably don't want to zip it in a temp folder or your downloads folder)
- Double click oTree.bat (or, if it doesn't work, oTree.exe, but you may see an antivirus warning)
- Note: the oTree launcher is not installed as an app in your start menu. To reopen the launcher, simply double click oTree.bat again.

## Mac/Linux
- Download and unzip the [oTree launcher](https://github.com/oTree-org/otree-launcher/archive/master.zip)
to an easy-to-access location, because you will go here every time you want to run the oTree launcher.
(In other words, you probably don't want to zip it in a temp folder or your downloads folder)
- Open the terminal and run oTree.sh
- Note: the oTree launcher is not installed as an app in your Applications folder. To reopen the launcher, simply run oTree.sh again.

## After installing
- When the app window launches, click the buttons to create a new deploy and  choose a location to store your project files.
- Click runserver button
