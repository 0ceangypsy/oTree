### Windows 
- Install Python 2.7 from Python.org
- Download and unzip: https://github.com/oTree-org/otree-launcher/archive/master.zip
- double click oTree.bat (or oTree.exe, but that may give you a virus warning because the executable has not yet been digitally signed).
- When the app window launches, click the buttons to create a new deploy and  choose a location to store your project files.
- Click runserver button

### Linux 

Follow the steps above, with the exception that you have to run oTree.sh from the root of archive folder.
