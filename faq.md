#### How stable is oTree?

oTree is in beta. Some parts of oTree are still under development and may have bugs.
Therefore, if you are launching a real experiment,
you should start developing and testing well in advance, to prevent last-minute surprises,
and to give us time to investigate any bugs you discover.
(If you encounter a bug in oTree, please email chris@otree.org.)

For best results, contact us so that we are aware of your plans and can give you guidance.

Also, make sure to upgrade otree-core frequently, to get our latest bugfixes.
In the launcher, click "Version select" and choose the most recent version.
We recommend doing this on a weekly basis.
