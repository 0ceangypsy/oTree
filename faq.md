#### Can I use oTree for free?

Yes, oTree is licensed under the
<a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT" target="_blank">MIT open source license</a>
with the added requirement of a citation of our
[paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbef.2015.12.001).

#### Is it easy to start with oTree?

Yes, it is easy to modify one of our 20 existing games or create your own.
(check out the [tutorial]({{ site.url_tutorial }}) or the [docs]({{ site.url_docs }}) for guidelines).

#### Where can I ask oTree programming questions?

We have an active community on Google Groups
[here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/otree).
There are several posts per day usually.

#### How can I contribute to oTree?

The simplest way to contribute is to use oTree yourself,
and then send notes about your experience to chris@otree.org.
You could tell us about your experience getting started and any issues you noticed,
even if they are minor.
Your feedback will help us to make fixes in the software or improve the documentation.

#### Can I use oTree with Amazon Mechanical Turk?

Yes, oTree has integration with AMT
(checkout the [docs]({{ site.url_docs }}) for guidelines).

#### Are you available for workshops?

Yes, I have done a number of workshops, on a paid basis.
I can come to your institution and give a few days of instruction.

Usually the first day starts with a 1-hour overview of oTree for a general
audience. Then we begin with hands-on instructions on how to program oTree
experiments, as well as things like deploying to Mechanical Turk, using bots,
using the admin interface, setting up a server, etc.

No prior experience with oTree is necessary, although participants
should have completed a basic tutorial in Python programming.

If interested, contact chris@otree.org.

#### Are you available for development of oTree experiments?

Yes, please contact chris@otree.org.
