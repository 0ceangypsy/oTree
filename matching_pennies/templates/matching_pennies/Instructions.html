    </h3>

    <p>
        In this study you will play three rounds of "Matching Pennies".
    </p>

    <p>
        At the beginning, you will be randomly assigned to an opponent and will
        keep playing against that same opponent in all three rounds.
    </p>

    <p>
        Player 1 chooses either "Heads" or "Tails". Player 2 guesses what
        Player 1 chose.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>If the guess is correct, Player 2 receives 100 points and Player 1
            receives nothing.
        </li>
        <li>If the guess is incorrect, Player 1 receives 100 points and Player
            2 receives nothing.
        </li>
    </ul>
