oTree provides integration with <strong><a href="https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome" target="_blank">Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT)</a></strong>. oTree authenticates users visiting from the AMT service, and then sends payments to the correct AMT account. Researchers, however, must have an employer account with AMT, which currently requires a U.S. address and bank account.
