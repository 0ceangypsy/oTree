oTree comes with an admin interface, so that experimenters can manage sessions, monitor the progress of live sessions, and export data after sessions.

Open your browser to the root url of your web application. If you're developing locally, this will be http://127.0.0.1:8000/. This will give you a login screen. Log in with the admin username and password specified in `settings.py`.
