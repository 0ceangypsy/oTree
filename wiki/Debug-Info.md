Any application can be run so that that debug information is displayed on the bottom of all screens. The debug information consists of the ID in group, the group, the player, the participant label, and the session code. The session code and participant label are two randomly generated alphanumeric codes uniquely identifying the session and participant. The ID in group identies the role of the player (e.g., in a principal-agent game, principals
might have the ID in group 1, while agents have 2).
