You can download your raw data in text format (CSV) so that you can view and analyze it with a program like Excel, Stata, or R. Go to the "Export data" table and choose your app.

You can also download a documentation file for each app, which explains the meaning of the different variable names. It is auto-generated from your source code. Whatever you specify in a model field's `doc=` argument will show up here.
