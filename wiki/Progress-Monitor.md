The progress monitor allows the researcher to monitor the progress of an experiment. It features a display that can be **filtered** and **sorted**, for example by computer name or group. The experimenter can see the progress of all participants, including their current action and taken decisions. Updates are shown as they happen **in real time** and cells that change are highlighted in yellow. Because the progress monitor is web-based, **multiple collaborators can simultaneously open it on several devices on premises or at remote locations**.
