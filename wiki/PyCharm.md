To ease the learning curve of oTree, we strongly recommend using [PyCharm Professional](http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), even though there are many other good editors for Python code. This is because:

* PyCharm has features that make oTree/Django development easier
* oTree has special integration with PyCharm's code completion functionality
* This documentation gives instructions assuming you are using PyCharm
* oTree has been thoroughly tested with PyCharm

If you are a student, teacher, or professor, PyCharm Professional is [free](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/). Note: we recommend PyCharm Professional rather than PyCharm Community Edition.


_TODO:_
* runserver & debug
