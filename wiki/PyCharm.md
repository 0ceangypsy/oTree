To ease the learning curve of oTree, we strongly recommend using [PyCharm Professional](http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), even though there are many other good editors for Python code. This is because:

* PyCharm has features that make oTree/Django development easier
* oTree has special integration with PyCharm's code completion functionality
* This documentation gives instructions assuming you are using PyCharm
* We have not tested oTree with other editors

The free 30-day trial of the Professional Edition is recommended. After 30 days, you can either get a free Classroom License
(as explained [here](http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/buy/index.jsp),
or downgrade to the free Community Edition, 
or buy an Academic License for $29.

_TODO:_
* how to select virtualenv interpreter
* runserver & debug
