The session interface is an optional feature convenient in some experiments. In many experimental settings, in addition to monitoring, **an experimenter needs to receive instructions or provide input for the experiment**. The session interface can instruct an experimenter on what to do next and show text to be read aloud. The session interface can also request input from the experimenter at a specic point in the session. For example, in an Ellsberg experiment, the experimenter might roll an opaque urn prior to the session; the session interface will remind the experimenter to show the urn to the participants, tell the experimenter when all participants have selected their bets, and instruct her to draw a ball from the urn. It will then ask the drawn color, so that oTree can calculate participants' payoffs.
